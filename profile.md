### Are you hiring?

I'm looking for work, and ideally I'd love to work as a **data analyst** or some related role.  I have some basic website skills as well.  In the long run, if the job involves conservation or even green tech, that would be a dream.  I did about 90% of the [Udemy Web Development Bootcamp][udemy-web-dev] at the start of the year.

Through my years in the tourism industry I've learned **leadership** and simple hard work.  I've managed small teams and worked with high-end clientele.
