<h3>Giving Feedback </h3>

- 1. What's an example of an issue I have had in working with another team member? How have I addressed it?

I have not experienced much confrontation because I have always been open to new ideas or thoughts on projects different than mine, but one time I did received feedback from a team member who wanted different styling done within the project than I had already. They said they had originally used a WYSIWYG editor to create the HTML and CSS for the project to create a typical look and styling through the app, so my styling I had already done did not match what they had already intended for the project. I did not want their stylings to go to waste so I quickly copied the CSS over into the project and remade all the elements to fit what they had intended in the first place. After seeing what they wanted I saw my development module fit much better with all the other components and pages already within the project. This was important because my original made me stickout from everyone so the styling did not look neutral with everyone elses modules they had made in the Scribble Stadium Organization.     


- 2. What are some benefits and challenges to working with the different personalities and work styles on my team? 

I think it is great to see views or opinions different than mine when it comes to working on a project. I am new to the professional fullstack development community; so learning from others who have had more experience than me is important. I am interested in collaborating with others for the future. I want to benefit from differences of coding styles to acquire a productive, programmatic, stable system to produce and test the most efficient software available. Technlogies greatest aspect to evolution is to mold greater software products as an ability to learn, enhance, or replicate other coding examples which hold an efficent development environment.        

<h3>Receiving Feedback </h3>

- 1. How do your teammates tend to describe you?
What's the most difficult piece of feedback you've ever received?

Teammates tend to describe me as diligent, productive, and receptive to change. I think the need for change in technology should always be ongoing so the most difficult pieces of feedback to receive is feedback on code where no changes are expected. I have always been accustomed to search for changes even after MVP has been made. This always furthered my understanding to the material while conducting my own playground of the MVP assignment.

- 2. How have you incorporated that feedback into your personal development?

I think natural code refactoring, functional recursion, explicit/implicit object referencing, or data encapsulation are all great examples to receiving feedback on changing a module that has already met standard MVP expectations. Fundamentally these concepts are all great ways to polish any finished piece into a professional build that should withstand any future updates, tests or new build/deployment.

<h2>About</h2>

I am skilled in flow-chart creation to design popular user interfaces and user experience designs to streamline cross compatibility and accessibility. I am very interested in creating websites, applications, and games to display similar user experiences despite differences of client screen size. I have contributed to projects and worked in teams with other programmers to design projects that complete goals outlined within the rubric or user's story. I am currently interested in PERN/MERN stack development jobs where nodejs, express, and react are being used for websites, games, or software development.

<h2>Education</h2>
<b>Lambda School of Code, Online</b><i> — Full Stack Web Development & Computer Science</i>
<br>
MAR 2020 - JULY 2021
<br>
Completed projects, assignments, & new material walk through examples all pertaining to Framework Testing, CSS, Javascript, React, Node.js, & Computer Science in Python. At the end of the last course’s section was lab assignments where I got to experience what it is like to work with a team to design a project from scratch or by other programmer’s code. Readme documentation was written and trello boards were used to stay  organized as to who would complete what user stories for pull requests on the finished project. This is where I have gained my skill sets to have the confidence to participate in testing and developing real front/back-end design projects. Lambda has taught me very valuable skill sets that will make me an in demand developer. Not only have I gained valuable guided walk through code but I have also been able to participate in my own assignments where I was able to exercise what I learned. The school is very determined to supply all the tools needed for me to land a career making over $50,000 a year. They prove this by offering career coaches who guide all students on what is needed to gain a career in the tech field as a full stack developer by using the newest most stable technology available today.

<br>
<b>Udemy, Online </b> <i> - E-commerce/Web Development, Penetration Testing, 3D-Graphical Designs & Game Development</i>
<br>
JAN 2015 - PRESENT
<br>
This is where I have gained experience with PHP  and learned what regex is to create e-commerce development level projects which use an admin exclusive content management system for all products and features easily moderated by the admin. I took courses here on network penetration testing & ethical hacking which not only opened my understanding on how to benchmark the security of an OS or network on a virtual machine, but it also helped me make the switch from windows to linux to use as a main operating system with Debian. This is also where I gained experience with CryEngine, Unity, and Unreal Engine to learn how to create 3D games with C++ or C#. 3D games were what first sparked my interest to become a developer . The very first gaming library I gained experience on was XNA using C# because I wanted to make an Xbox game. That then led to learning how to create 3D models and animations with Blender. After learning enough about Blender I realized I needed to first know more about Python to create good animation and 3D modeling scripts. The long haul at Udemy kept bringing me back to a real understanding of if I wanted to start off a career as a programer it might be best to learn React and Redux state management, get much better at Javascript, and learn how to manage a persistent database across a network with Node.js; this is why I chose to attend Lambda.

It happens because the atoms of the individual pieces of metal have no way of knowing that they are different pieces of metal, so the lumps join together.This wouldn't happen on Earth because there is air and water separating the pieces. Its similar to principles of metal-based construction within vacuums.

- [x] The pentereach app is designed to allow a user to place articles within containers for research. This project was made from scratch right after learning Javascript, which was the 2nd section before learning React as a front-end design library. The main goal of the project was to demonstrate responsiveness, styling with flex, and a few functionality features with Javascript.

There are more to come as I start to deploy them from github, they will all be added here. The first link is the first version and the second link is the 2nd version which has more projects on it. Because a portfolio is so important I have two different domains its being hosted on. In the event that one link does not working properly. The other link should be dependable enough.
